# Capstone Project: Reinforcement Learning For Power Grid Security

The past few years have seen an increase of both the frequency and magnitude for hurricanes in the southern gulf coast region. Additionally, more natural disasters such as the 2021 Texas Freeze and west coast wildfires have proven that in the future, we will need more resilient power grids in place. The problem arises: how can we most efficiently defend against a hurricane in the most intelligent way possible, given a local government’s or power company’s limited resources? We also aimed to find a solution to this problem that defends against different attackers, because as the attack behavior changes, so does the best way to defend the grid. For example, in addition to defending against natural disasters, we also aim to defend against potential cyber attacks. Cyber attack behavior will differ from a hurricane’s behavior because the attacker will be “smart”. Similarly, natural disasters can greatly differ from each other. With these differences in mind, we aimed to create a solution that improves resilience of a power grid across several different attacking schemes.
